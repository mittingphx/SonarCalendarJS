# TASKS.md
To use this, tell the agent to complete the tasks under one of the sections, like "Project Setup".

## Instructions
This file is for tracking tasks that need to be completed.
The format is as follows:
- [ ] Task Name
- [X] Completed Task Name

The agent should update this file as it completes tasks.
Tasks should be organized into sections named using ## Headers.

## Project Setup
